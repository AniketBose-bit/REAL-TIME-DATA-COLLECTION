# REAL-TIME-DATA-COLLECTION

This Real-Time Stock Data Collection project offers a solution for fetching live stock market data, with a focus on U.S. markets. Built using Python and the `yfinance` library, it provides real-time stock data, including current opening prices, without requiring API keys, making it accessible for users facing issues with APIs like IEX Cloud and Alpha Vantage. The primary project file, `Real_Time_Stock_Data_Collection.ipynb`, is a Jupyter Notebook that contains code and documentation. To use it, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the notebook to retrieve and customize stock data as needed. Future improvements include expanding to other stock markets, enhancing data visualization, and incorporating historical data. Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
